'''1. Multiple inheritance example - Imagine a Smartphone that combines features of a Camera and a 
Phone. Use multiple inheritance to implement the following.
The Camera class - variable resolution and method (Take photo)
The Phone class â€“Phone number as variable with methods such as making calls and sending 
messages.
The Smartphone class inherits from both, combining the features of both a camera and a phone
with additional variables such as brand and model. Method in smart phone is : display device 
information.
