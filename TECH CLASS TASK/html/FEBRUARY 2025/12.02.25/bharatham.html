            <h2>Bharatanatyam: The Divine Dance of India</h2>
            <p>Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest and most revered classical dance forms of India, originating from the temples of Tamil Nadu. It is a blend of expressions (Bhava), melody (Raga), rhythm (Tala), and dance (Natya), forming the acronym Bharata. This art form is deeply spiritual and was traditionally performed as an offering to the deities in temples. Over time, it has evolved into a global cultural symbol of Indian heritage.</p>

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>Bharatanatyam has its roots in the Natya Shastra, the ancient treatise on performing arts written by sage Bharata. Originally, it was performed by Devadasis, women dedicated to temple worship. The dance was an integral part of religious rituals, narrating stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita. During the colonial period, Bharatanatyam declined but was later revived and redefined by pioneers like Rukmini Devi Arundale, who transformed it into a respected stage art form.</p>

                2.Nritya (Expressive Dance): Combines facial expressions, hand gestures (mudras), and body movements to convey emotions and narratives.<br>
                3.Natya (Dramatic Art): The theatrical aspect that integrates storytelling with dance.</p>
